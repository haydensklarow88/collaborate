# üöÄ Ready to Deploy - Trailing Slash Fix Applied

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

1. **`src/auth/cognitoConfig.js`**: Updated `redirect_uri` to `${origin}/oidc-callback/` (with trailing slash)
2. **`public/_redirects`**: Added explicit routes for `/oidc-callback`, `/oidc-callback/`, `/post-auth`, etc.
3. **Build completed**: Fresh `dist/` folder ready for deployment

## üîß Action Required in AWS Cognito Console

### Go to: App Client Settings for ID `1ohivbrbk8aitpge7lu7ov1kna`

**Update Allowed callback URLs to include the trailing slash:**

```
https://chimerical-daifuku-f66dd6.netlify.app/oidc-callback/
http://localhost:5173/oidc-callback/
```

**Update Allowed sign-out URLs:**

```
https://chimerical-daifuku-f66dd6.netlify.app/logout
http://localhost:5173/logout
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: The trailing slash `/` at the end of `/oidc-callback/` is REQUIRED for exact match!

## ‚úÖ Test Checklist After Deploy

1. Visit `https://chimerical-daifuku-f66dd6.netlify.app/signin`
2. Click "Sign in" button
3. **Expected behavior**: Immediately redirects to Cognito Hosted UI (no "Redirecting‚Ä¶" stuck state)
4. Enter credentials on Cognito page
5. **Expected return**: Redirects to `/oidc-callback/` ‚Üí processes code ‚Üí routes to `/post-auth`
6. **Final destination**: Role selection or dashboard based on user role

## üîç Debug if Still Stuck

### Check Network Tab
Look for the authorize request:
```
https://us-east-1e7jguoyub.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/authorize
  ?client_id=1ohivbrbk8aitpge7lu7ov1kna
  &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fchimerical-daifuku-f66dd6.netlify.app%2Foidc-callback%2F
```

The `redirect_uri` parameter (URL-decoded) MUST match exactly what's in Cognito:
- ‚úÖ `https://chimerical-daifuku-f66dd6.netlify.app/oidc-callback/`
- ‚ùå `https://chimerical-daifuku-f66dd6.netlify.app/oidc-callback` (missing trailing slash)

### Check Console Warnings
The OIDC diagnostic should no longer show the trailing slash warning after this fix.

---

## üìù Summary

**Problem**: `redirect_uri` didn't match Cognito's exact expectation (missing trailing slash)  
**Solution**: Added trailing slash to `redirect_uri` in config and updated Cognito callback URLs  
**Result**: Sign-in button will now navigate immediately to Hosted UI without getting stuck

Deploy the new `dist/` folder and update Cognito, then test! üéâ
