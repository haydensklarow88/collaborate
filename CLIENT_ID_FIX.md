# 🔧 CLIENT ID FIX SUMMARY

## The Problem
```
❌ Production was using: 3a4msro5du1e9sg902s0dh3ujg (not configured)
   └─> Result: redirect_mismatch error page
   └─> Result: React minified errors #418, #423

✅ Should be using:      1ohivbrbk8aitpge7lu7ov1kna (correctly configured)
   └─> Has callback URLs whitelisted
   └─> Should work perfectly
```

## The Fix
```diff
File: src/auth/cognitoConfig.js

- const clientId = ... || '3a4msro5du1e9sg902s0dh3ujg';
+ const clientId = ... || '1ohivbrbk8aitpge7lu7ov1kna';
```

## Verification
```bash
✅ Searched dist/assets/*.js for "1ohivbrbk8aitpge7lu7ov1kna" → FOUND
✅ Searched dist/assets/*.js for "3a4msro5du1e9sg902s0dh3ujg" → NOT FOUND

Result: Production bundle now uses correct client ID!
```

## Quick Deploy
```bash
# 1. Rebuild (already done)
npm run build

# 2. Set Netlify env vars (in Netlify UI):
VITE_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID=1ohivbrbk8aitpge7lu7ov1kna
VITE_COGNITO_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-site.netlify.app/
VITE_SIGNOUT_URI=https://your-site.netlify.app/logout

# 3. Deploy
# Drag dist/ folder to https://app.netlify.com/drop
# OR push to git if auto-deploy is enabled

# 4. Clear cache and redeploy (if updating existing site)
# Netlify → Deploys → Trigger deploy → Clear cache and deploy site
```

## What Should Happen Now
```
Before Fix:
User clicks "Sign In"
  → Redirects to Cognito
  → Shows: "An error was encountered with the requested page."
  → Error: redirect_mismatch

After Fix:
User clicks "Sign In"
  → Redirects to Cognito Hosted UI
  → Shows: Login form
  → User logs in
  → Redirects back to app successfully ✅
```

## Files Changed
```
✅ src/auth/cognitoConfig.js    - Changed default client ID
✅ .env.local                    - Created with correct values
✅ NETLIFY_ENV_SETUP.md          - Full Netlify instructions
✅ DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md       - Step-by-step deploy guide
✅ dist/                         - Rebuilt with correct client ID
```

## Your Cognito App Clients
```
App Client 1: 3a4msro5du1e9sg902s0dh3ujg
├─ Status: ❌ Not configured for your domains
├─ Callback URLs: (probably missing your Netlify URLs)
└─ Do NOT use this one

App Client 2: 1ohivbrbk8aitpge7lu7ov1kna  ⭐ USE THIS ONE
├─ Status: ✅ Correctly configured
├─ Callback URLs: 
│  ├─ http://localhost:5173/
│  └─ https://chimerical-daifuku-f66dd6.netlify.app/
├─ Sign-out URLs:
│  ├─ http://localhost:5173/logout
│  └─ https://chimerical-daifuku-f66dd6.netlify.app/logout
└─ This is the one that works!
```

## Next Step: Deploy!
Your `dist/` folder is ready to deploy right now with the correct client ID.
