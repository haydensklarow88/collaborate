# üéØ COGNITO CLIENT ID FIX - DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### Problem Identified
Your app was using **TWO different Cognito App Client IDs**:
- ‚ùå `3a4msro5du1e9sg902s0dh3ujg` (OLD - not configured, causes redirect_mismatch)
- ‚úÖ `1ohivbrbk8aitpge7lu7ov1kna` (CORRECT - has all URLs whitelisted)

### Changes Made
1. ‚úÖ Updated `src/auth/cognitoConfig.js` default fallback to use correct client ID
2. ‚úÖ Created `.env.local` with correct configuration for local dev
3. ‚úÖ Rebuilt app - verified correct client ID is in the bundle
4. ‚úÖ Verified old client ID is NOT in the bundle

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Verify AWS Cognito Configuration
In AWS Console ‚Üí Cognito ‚Üí App Client `1ohivbrbk8aitpge7lu7ov1kna`:

**Allowed callback URLs:**
```
http://localhost:5173/
https://chimerical-daifuku-f66dd6.netlify.app/
```

**Allowed sign-out URLs:**
```
http://localhost:5173/logout
https://chimerical-daifuku-f66dd6.netlify.app/logout
```

**OAuth 2.0 Grant Types:**
- ‚úÖ Authorization code grant

**OAuth Scopes:**
- ‚úÖ openid
- ‚úÖ email  
- ‚úÖ profile

### Step 2: Set Netlify Environment Variables

Go to Netlify ‚Üí Site settings ‚Üí Environment variables ‚Üí Add:

```bash
VITE_COGNITO_AUTHORITY=https://us-east-1e7jguoyub.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com
VITE_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID=1ohivbrbk8aitpge7lu7ov1kna
VITE_COGNITO_REDIRECT_URI=https://chimerical-daifuku-f66dd6.netlify.app/
VITE_SIGNOUT_URI=https://chimerical-daifuku-f66dd6.netlify.app/logout
VITE_COGNITO_SCOPE=openid email profile
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL:** Update the URLs to match your **actual** Netlify domain!

### Step 3: Deploy to Netlify

**Option A: Netlify Drop (Drag & Drop)**
1. Drag the entire `dist/` folder to: https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. Site will be live immediately

**Option B: Git Deploy**
1. Push changes to your git repository
2. Netlify will auto-build and deploy

**Option C: Manual Deploy via CLI**
```bash
# If you have Netlify CLI installed
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

### Step 4: Clear Netlify Cache (Important!)
If redeploying an existing site:
1. Go to Netlify ‚Üí Deploys
2. Click "Trigger deploy"
3. Select **"Clear cache and deploy site"**

This ensures the new env vars are picked up.

### Step 5: Test the Login Flow

1. Visit your Netlify URL: `https://chimerical-daifuku-f66dd6.netlify.app/`
2. Click "Sign In"
3. Should redirect to AWS Cognito Hosted UI (no redirect_mismatch error!)
4. Log in with your credentials
5. Should redirect back to your app successfully

### Step 6: Verify in Browser DevTools

Open Network tab and check the `/oauth2/authorize` request:
- ‚úÖ `client_id=1ohivbrbk8aitpge7lu7ov1kna` (correct!)
- ‚úÖ `redirect_uri=https://chimerical-daifuku-f66dd6.netlify.app/` (matches Cognito)
- ‚úÖ No `redirect_mismatch` error

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Still seeing redirect_mismatch?
- [ ] Double-check Cognito callback URLs **exactly** match (including trailing slash)
- [ ] Verify you're using the correct App Client ID in Netlify env vars
- [ ] Clear browser cache and cookies
- [ ] Clear Netlify cache and redeploy

### React minified errors (#418, #423)?
- These are caused by the redirect_mismatch error
- Fix the Cognito URLs first, then these will disappear
- Clear browser cache after fixing

### Wrong client ID still appearing?
- [ ] Check Netlify env vars are set correctly
- [ ] Clear Netlify cache and redeploy
- [ ] Check Network tab to see which client_id is being sent

### Local development not working?
- [ ] Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`
- [ ] Update `.env.local` with your actual values
- [ ] Restart dev server: `npm run dev`

## üìã Verification Checklist

- [ ] AWS Cognito App Client `1ohivbrbk8aitpge7lu7ov1kna` has correct callback/sign-out URLs
- [ ] Netlify environment variables are set with correct values
- [ ] App rebuilt with `npm run build`
- [ ] Deployed to Netlify (with cache cleared)
- [ ] Login flow tested on production URL
- [ ] No redirect_mismatch error
- [ ] No React minified errors
- [ ] Successfully redirected back after login

## üéâ Success Indicators

When everything is working correctly:
1. Clicking "Sign In" redirects to Cognito Hosted UI smoothly
2. No error page saying "redirect_mismatch"
3. After login, redirects back to your app
4. User can access protected pages
5. No React errors in console

## üìû Still Need Help?

If you're still seeing issues:
1. Check the Network tab for the exact `client_id` being sent
2. Verify it matches `1ohivbrbk8aitpge7lu7ov1kna`
3. Check the `redirect_uri` parameter matches Cognito exactly
4. Share screenshots of:
   - Network tab OAuth request
   - Cognito App Client settings
   - Netlify environment variables
